# What is this?

This application was created to help aggregate computer systems information from multiple management and monitoring platforms. It is used by the Systems Operations and Desktop Engineering groups to check on the status, health, inventory and compliance of thousands of machines.

The front end is a simple admin interface with customizations. The bulk of the software development was in crafting the SQL and ruby code necessary to extract data from the various systems.

An example installation, with fake data, can be viewed [on Heroku](http://arcane-fortress-5987.heroku.com).


# Why is this here?

I have placed this application under my GitHub account as an example of my prior work. 100% of this code was written by me over the course of the past 3 years.  Inside this code base are all manner of mistakes and bad choices typical of someone self-thought. Nonetheless, this application is still used today at my former employer and I am proud to say that I wrote it. My intention is that this software will help explain my past Ruby / Rails experience, warts and all.

I have _not_ placed the code here with the intention of it being forked or redistributed, although I cannot prevent it. As I am not the copyright holder, I cannot grant any rights to this code.
